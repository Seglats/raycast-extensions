# Ping


Ping selected device with Find My. Works with devices accessible through iCloud. Note: Different Siri languages may require adjustments. This extension uses Siri because Find My does not have an internal or external API.

For it to work use the same shortcut as you have siri if you don't have a shortcut and generally do not use siri i recommend leaving it on the default "cmd + f13", then go in to settings siri and when you see configure shortcut go back to raycat go in to settings of the extension "cmd+shift+," and do "cmd+r" which will wait 10 seconds and then do that shortcut. Click on configure and wait for it to input.
