# Ping
A small extension to ping a device with the find my apple service, for apple devices. Works by running a shortcut to call siri and then inputing the "Ping my" and then user specified device to call device for example Iphone or Sophies Iphone/Rasmus Iphone...  

The shortcut was done cause nether find my nor siri has an external API, which is why this uses a bit of a weird way.
Could also not send fn button with apple script nor raycast api with what i found which is why its not supported as a keybind option. 

Setup is:
Select keybind you want to use with siri, then input it to siri ether normally or do 'cmd+r' to simulate keybind to forexample input 'cmd+f13' select delay to send keystroke default is 1 but can be lowered on newer devices, might need to make it slower on intel machines cause i have not tried it on any of them. 

Also apple intelegense seems to be required just cause otherwise you can't write to siri?
